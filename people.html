          <p>We’re family owned. Nicholas and Pen are married with two children, Sylvia and Arthur, who have grown up
            at the Home and Netherwood vineyards. Pen and Nicholas own and manage the business. Nicholas looks after
            our three vineyards and the wine making with his team; Pen manages the business and looks over the
            restaurant and cellar door with another wonderfulteam of people.
          </p>
          <p>Pen’s parents and siblings have invested in our land and vineyards since the beginning, helping make all
            of this
            possible. Pen’s father Rod is a 5th generation horticulturalist from North Otago, (interestingly, Rod’s
            family grew the
            first table grapes NZ). Pen’s mum Stacey provides much cheer and family support along with Nicholas’
            parents who help
            out with so much. Jo and Cam, Pen’s siblings are energetic supporters and offer fresh perspectives.

          <p>Russell and Kumiko Black planted the original Black Estate vines in 1993, at what is now called the Home
            Vineyard. We
            purchased that property from Russell in 2007. We kept the name and are grateful that Russell and Kumiko
            decided to
            plants vines on their Omihi hillside.
          </p>
          <p>
            This dream is only possible with our staff. Somehow, each person has followed a path to be here with us at
            Black Estate.
            We’re grateful and learning a lot from each other, and having quite a lot of fun along the way!
